  "description": "The Goblin Cave is the first in a series of location-based adventures called Becoming Heroes, where adventurers band together to resist a hobgoblin warlord from decimating their home. This adventure is designed for 1st-level characters and sees them answering the call to rescue captives held in a nearby cave. As they explore the dark caverns, they will come across deadly traps and nefarious goblins. In the depths below, a Hobgoblin Tormentor viciously extracts information from the villagers about the village’s defenses. If she is not defeated, she will return to her hideout with important knowledge: weaknesses that will spell the doom of the captives’ home.",
